As we know, the World Health Organization recognized that the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCov) constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Importance (ESPII), on January 30, 2020 and, on March 11, 2020, characterized it as pandemic, being necessary the special look for people who fall into the risk group and, above all, the people who are infected with enough disease. * Thus, those with chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, chronic heart disease, people with HIV, hypertension, people with chronic kidney failure, cancer or other diseases that weaken the immune system are even more exposed to the dangers of the disease and must be the priority target of policies aimed at mitigating the effects of pan<demia, as the Court of Justice of São Paulo acknowledged by Provence n. 2545/2020 of the Superior Council. That is the situation of the person arrested, the other applicant. In addition to the low self-immunity of persons arrested is the lack of adequate food, difficulty in the dispensing of medicine, little or no medical follow-up, poor conditions of housing of the cells and common prison sites, lack of bath water heating and restriction of access to basic hygiene and cleaning material, inherent in the Brazilian prison system. * This framework makes it essential for the release of these people, under penalty of condemning them to death in the prison system, which is obviously sealed by the Federal Constitution. In fact, the Court of Justice of São Paulo itself edited, through the Superior Council of the Magistrature, the provision No. 2546/2020, determining the release of adolescents who fall within these groups, recognizing the need for emptying to the maximum of the units that cost people. > The correct determination must, with greater reason, be applied to the prison system, because the conditions of the prisons are incomparably worse than those found in the CASA Foundation. In this sense, including Recommendation No 62/2020, of the National Council of Justice:<br> .. <br> Therefore, the well-known and demonstrated precariousness of prison facilities and their inadequacy to the needs of hygiene and health to prevent contamination and dissemination of the disease demonstrate the disproportionality of the prison, and cause the prison to extract the constitutional limits of the intervention XLart. <br> .. <br>Logo, the applicant\\'s home arrest must be granted.<br>À fl 99, so I crashed:<br> Before making any decision in this writ, we request information to the Judgement of the 1st Criminal Court of the Lins/SP District, within 72 hours, as to the alleged in the initial, as well as requesting, to the prison establishment where the patient Valter de Oliveira Albano is segregated, the following information: 1) its current health status, especially if it is inserted in the risk group described in the National Recommendation n. 62/20 The request must be accompanied by a copy of the petition of fls. 3/12.<br>After, the autos are returned.<br> On 14/9/2020, the Law of the 1st Criminal Court of the Lins/SP District has provided this information (fls. 201/202 - our purpose):<br> .. <br> . The patient Valter de Oliveira Albano is serving at the Lins Resocialization Center, currently under closed regime, with the end of fulfillment of the sentence scheduled for 19/3/2027.<br> The patient, with a request for conversion of regime, from the closed to home imprisonment, in accordance with Article 318, II, of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Provence 62 of the CN-19, in the face of the new wave of contamination by CObr>VIDV. The Public Prosecutor opined that the request was rejected. * By decision of 3/6/2020, the application was dismissed, for the absence of legal requirements. This happened because the patient did not prove the alleged fragilized immune system, due to severe arterial hypertension. And, on the other hand, the Lins Resocialization Center has satisfactory medical care and good hygiene conditions, and there is no news that there is contamination by COVID-19 in the prison unit; besides the patient is 41 years old.<br> I also emphasize that the patient had already entered with another request, through constituted lawyer, aiming at the granting of house arrest, which was registered under no. 1001702-70.20208.26.0322. In this case, by decision of 27/5/2020, the request was rejected, also because of the absence of legal requirements; because the patient did not prove to be extremely debilitated because of serious illness; because the patient did not prove to take more risk of contamination by the IOC-19 within the prison unit than was inserted in the social environment, since the risk is general and for all; and because the sentence is stuck in place that does not fall. The Court of Justice of São Paulo for assessment in 23/7/207/. In summary cognition judgment, it appears inviable to accept the pretension, because the alleged constraint is not presented with the sharpness impressed in the initial, especially because theinstance of origin mentioned that the patient did not compromise the alleged fragilized immune system, as a result of severe arterial hypertension. And, on the other hand, the Lins Resocialization Center has satisfactory medical care and good hygiene conditions, and there is no news that there is contamination by COVID-19 in the prison unit; in addition to the patient having 41 years of age(fls. 201/202 - our griffin). Apart from this, the persecuted precautionary providence is unquestionably satisfying for its definitive effects, at the time of its duration, necessarily resulting from the deconstitution of the effectiveness of the contested act, implying its acceptance usurpation of the competence of the collegiate body, prohibited from the Rapporteur. Such the context, I prudently reserve the definitive pronouncement for the appropriate time.<br> I therefore urge the injunction. * the Federal Public Ministry (f. 213/226), the Federal Prosecutor’s Office (Federal Public Ministry) noted the lack of knowledge of the habrbeas corpus. The irresignation does not deserve to prosper. * To the pleas in the injunction, I add these words of the Deputy General of the Republic Raquel Elias Ferreira Dodge, which, by the accuracy and clarity of the explicit elements and by being in perfect harmony with the jurisprudential orientation of this Superior Court, also adopted as a reason to decide (fls. 230/231- our prerogative):<br> . <br> According to the recent National Recommendation No. 62/20 Let\\'s see:<br> .. Art. 5. Recommend to magistrates competently on the criminal execution which, with a view to the reduction of epidemiological risks and in compliance with the local context of the spread of the virus, consider the following measures:<br> .. <br>III - grant of house arrest in relation to all persons arrested in compliance with penalty in open and semi-open regime, subject to conditions to be defined by the execution judge-19;br< According to the information provided by the Court of origin, the Lins Resocialization Center has satisfactory medical assistance and good hygiene conditions, and there is no news that there is communication by the IOC-19 in the prison unit. In addition, the patient is young, aged 41, not in the age range of risk. It should be noted that the above-mentioned Health Recommendation depends on each specific case and cannot be deferred in order to aggravate public safety, according to the CNJ. There is therefore the need for the judge to consider between these two legal goods (right to health and public safety) in the specific case. * At the point, the weightings of Minister Rogerio Schietti are relevant: \"the crisis of the new coronavirus must always be taken into account in the analysis of the claims of release of prisoners, but, inevidently, it is not a free pass for the release of all, because the right of the collective to see preserved social peace, which does not fall apart from the idea that the system of criminal justice is to be effective, of collective conduct.\" The same opportune direction also mentions these precedents: AgRg no HC no. 701.582/SP, Minister Reynaldo Soares da Fonseca, Quinta Turma, DJe 12/11/2021; AgRg no HC no. 696.422/MS, Minister Rogerio Schietti Cruz, Friday 2020 Publish yourself.<br>EMENT<br>HABEAS CORPUS.

It also points to a jurisprudential divergence with STJ judges on the subject. (e-STJ). Admitted to the processing of the resource at source, depending on the decision of fls. 441-443 (e-STJ), the defendants ascended to this Court.<br> It is the report.<br>Decido.<br> This feature deserves to thrive.<br>1. In fact, the Court of First Instance concluded that the value of the fine applied was not possible, since the percentage is due to the legal forecast itself. (e-STJ, fl. 350):<br> Finally, the applicant seeks to reduce the value of the fine, since the absence of registration of the incorporation did not represent any prejudice to the appeals, especially because they chose to resolve the contract.<br> Thus, the situation falls within the scope of Article 4(1) of the judgment. * Although this Rapporteurship has already pointed out the possibility of equitablely reducing the level of the sanction (AC No. 0309704-47.2016.8.24.0005, deBalneário Camboriú, j. 16-4-2019), the understanding in this Fifth Chamber of Civil Law was established in the purpose that, as the index of thelegislation itself goes down to the judge exercising any valuation on thegravity of the censorship.

Action supported on 10/04/2015. Special appeal completed on 10/09/2018. Judgment: CPC/2015.<br>3. The recursal purpose is to define whether it is possible, based on Art.413 of the CC/02, the equitable reduction of the fine provided for in Art. 35, § 5, of Law 4.591/64.<br>4. The special feature cannot be known when the express indication of the violated legal device is absent.<br>5. The absence of a decision on the legal devices indicated as violates prevents the knowledge of the special feature.<br>6. The fine stipulated by Art. 35, § 5, of Law 4.591/64 is a criminal clause inserted in the contract between the incorporator and the acquirer, subjecting, therefore, to the Civil Code devices which have the limitations of the penal clause.<br>7. In the present case, there is a matter of temporal right to be sanctioned, because the fine provided for in Law 4.591/64 is prior to the provisions of the Civil Code relating to the criminal clause. Thus, the principle of the later law derogates the previous one (lex posterior derrogat priori).<br>8. In view of the fact that the recursal purpose of this appeal is solely to define the possibility of the equitable reduction of the fine provided for in special law, on the basis of Article 413 of the CC/02, it is imperative to return the self to the Court of origin so that, in the light of the understanding established in the present self, the penalty, in the concrete case, must be considered manifestly excessive, in view of the nature and purpose of the business. > 9.

The alleged violation of Article 535 of the CPC is not glimpsed, since it does not characterize, by itself, omission, contradiction or obscurity the fact that the court has adopted another plea which is not defended by the party.<br>2. The revision of the fundamentals that led to the completion of the local Court, with regard to the non-setting of defense in view of the lack of oral proof, would require the examination of the fiat-probatory set, which is sealed in the special instance, according to the content of the statement of the Sumula 7/STJ.<br>3. In relation to the action aimed at civil reparation for damages arising from the non-compliance with contractual obligation, the understanding of this Superior Court is firm to be declining the prescriptional deadline, according to Article 205 of the Civil Code. Sumula 83/STJ.<br>4. The fixing of the penal clause may not be indistinct to the contractor's fault, since the legal order provides for imperative and cogent standards, which have the purpose of safeguarding the weakest part of the contract, such as Article 412 of the CC/2002. Although there is no possibility of determining the exclusion of the fine, since this would discharacterize the impositive pretension of the legislator, it is appropriate to apply the approach outlined by Art. 413 of the Civil Code, in which the equitable reduction of the amount is contemplated, if excessive, by the judge, taking into account the nature and purpose of the legal business. Special appeal partially provided.<br>(REsp 1520327/SP, Rel. Minister LUIS FELIPE SALOMÃO, QUARTA TURMA, judged on 05/05/2016, DJe 27/05/2016)<br> Accordingly, the Court’s view at the point denies the orientation established in this Superior Court on the matter, and must prosper the applicant’s irresignation to reform the judgment under appeal. * In this context, admitting the possibility of equitable reduction of the fine in the light of Article 413 of the Civil Code, it is necessary to return the right to the Court of origin so that, in the light of the understanding signed in the present selfs, the penalty, in the concrete case, must be considered manifestly excessive, in view of the nature and purpose of the business, in order to justify its reduction. <br>2. From the foregoing, on the basis of Art. 932 of the New Code of Civil Procedure c/c Súmula 568/STJ, I provide the special remedy to determine the return of the autos to the local Court, so that the same verifies whether, in the concrete case, the same amount reached manifestly excessive, given the nature and purpose of the business<.br>Publy.\",\n",
       "        'DECISION<br> It is considered an ordinary appeal in a security order brought by ELAINE CRISTINA GONCALVES VELOZA, on the basis of Article 105, II, b, of the Federal Constitution, against the v. judgment of the eg. Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo. <br>Constance of this procedural notebook which, at the origin, the recurring ora filed extraordinary usucapião action, claiming to be possessive of the integrality of the property object of the action, which was \"acquired by its grandparents on 11/06/1969, according to Private Purchase and Sales Promise Agreement\", fl. 13.br<> Still in the postulative phase, the MM Law Judge of the 2nd Public Registry Court of the Central Civil Forum of the District of São Paulo - SP determined the amendment of the initial petition, within 15 days, fls. 22-27.<br> The author, then, opposed declaration embargoes, to the argument that the \"decision determined the amendment to the initial petition in a generic way, without detailing the documents. The declaration embargoes were rejected on the grounds that \"the guerrilla decision was sufficiently clear as to the determinations necessary for the continuation of the proceeding, thus taking into account the command inserted in Article 321 of the CPC, so that it is for the part, in view of the documents already presented and of the corrections requested, to comply with the judicial command within the time indicated, not being able to speak in omission, contradiction or obscurity to ensejar the present. Inconformed with the decisum, the author held a warrant of security with an injunction request, stating that aMMa. Law Judge \"determined the amendment to the initial petition in a generic interlocutory decision of 6 (six) laudas, highlighted in 22 (twenty-two) items that indicate possible missing documents in the action of usucapião\". It held that the coatora authority supplied its liquid right and right to have a decision based on the legal determination of Article 321 of the Civil Procedure Code, which governs \"the obligation of the magistrate to accurately indicate what must be corrected or supplemented.\" The urgent measure was rejected by the plea that \"there are no clearing of the necessary requirements for the granting of the pleiterate injunction, especially in the light of the thesis in the 988 signed by the Superior Court of Justice in the systematic trial of repetitive resources, and the imminence of risk of damage to the impetant is not sufficient to comply with the relevant items of the questioned decision\", p. 33. In examining the question, the Court of Justice denies security in accordance with the judgment thus emented:<br>\"CYVEL SECURITY MARKET. Usucapião - Decision determining amendment to the Initial with 22 (twenty-two) generic content items and in part, supposedly inapplicable to the specific case Hypothesis that does not prevent the processing of the done Absence of violation of net and certain law of the Impetrante, at least in endoprocessual question - Decision maintained _ On the grounds of this ordinary security order appeal, the applicant alleges, in summary, that both the decision appointed and the act co-actor whereas the judgment under appeal \"does not observe the legal criterion determined by the Civil Procedure Code,\" p. 59.<br> Summarizes the argument in the sense that \"in accordance with Article 321 of the Civil Procedure Code, the decision determining the amendment to the initial shall accurately indicate what should be corrected.

The heroic remedy has a specific procedure, provided for in Law 12,016/2009, which provides for the possibility of granting injunction. CPC rules are therefore subsidiary application. For this reason, Art. 5, II of the former Security Mandate Law (Law 1.533/51) stated that \"there will be no warrant of security when it comes to an order or judicial decision when there is a remedy provided for in the procedural laws or may be modified by means of correction\". <br> Also, the current Law of the Security Mandate (Law 12,016/2009), in its article 5, II, discipline that \"will not be granted a warrant of security when it comes to a judicial decision of which it is subject to a suspensive remedy\", and in that same sense the content of the Suffula 267/STF: \"It is not a warrant of security against judicial action that is liable to appeal or correction.\" The caselaw of the Superior Court of Justice has admitted that the judicial act contains an unlawful or teratology act, violating the right and right of the party.

In accordance with the consolidated jurisprudence of this Court, \"The decision given in the precautionary action of early production of evidence is merely homologatory, which does not produce material judgment, admitting that the possible criticisms of the expert reports are carried out in the main documents, an opportunity in which the Magistrate will make the proper valuation of the evidence\" (Resp 1.191.622/MT, Minister MASSAMI UYEDA, TERCEIRA TURMA, judged on 25/10/2011, DJe of 08/11/2011.5.

The initial petition shall not be rejected if, in spite of the lack of information referred to in paragraph II, it is possible to quote the defendant. The initial petition will be instructed with the documents necessary for the purpose of the action.<br>Art. 321. The judge, when verifying that the initial petition does not meet the requirements of Arts. 319 and 320 or that it presents defects and irregularities capable of hindering the merits judgment, will determine that the author, within 15 (fifteen) days, emends or completes it, accurately indicating what should be corrected or completed. If the author does not comply with the diligence, the judge will dismiss the initial petition. * Under the aegis of the Democratic State of Law and Constitutional procedural law, the civil process serves as a tool of coherence and as indicative standard of objective rules, conducting a formally just and isonomic process, repelling subjective and variable conduct of the legal rite, stewing just decisions. The Court of First Instance is entitled to assess the presence of the conditions of action, procedural assumptions and other circumstances which enable the regular procedure to be carried out. In the event of a failure, irregularity or gap in the initial petition, the Judge shall grant a period of 15 days for the author to issue the petition or to complete it, \"indicating precisely what must be corrected or completed,\" under penalty of indeferment of the exordiale, consequently of termination of the proceedings without merit resolution, in accordance with Article 321, paragraph only c/c Article 485, incise Ibr. As we have seen from the above transcript, the legal procedural norm expressly determines the caselaw that indicates \"precisely\" i.e. accurately, clearly, objectively, clairvoyant, which should the party correct or complementary.<br> There is, therefore, a net and certain right guaranteed in the procedural law to the jurisdiction. Right as to the existence, delimited as to the extension and fit to be exercised in accordance with the law. In this way, the judicial act ordering the amendment to the initial by means of a preconceived and obscure formula, without the necessary clarity and accuracy guaranteed in law, violates that net and right law, because it should necessarily indicate clearly and accurately the vices to be sanctioned, drawing on the constitutional requirement of motivation provided for in Article 93, IX, of the CF.br> Thus, contrary to what is understood by the ordinary instances, in a process based on the collaboration, the order of amendment to the initial petition cannot have abstraction and generality contours, launched in imprecise, bureaucratic and adrede standard text written by the magistrate, without due consideration for the party to remain a specific case. Such conduct only conflicted jurisdiction and its patron, leaving aside to understand what should be sanctioned and without advancing what will come in the sequence, stewarding insecurity, imposing subjectivism to the course of the process, obligating the production of unnecessary procedural acts and establishing a riteineficial and uncertain, impossibilitying the appropriate defense of the questioned law. In the context of the modern civil proceedings, the amendment of the initial petition is the subjective right of the author, enabling corrections and complements to be adequately opportunized to the party, the principles of cooperation and the use of procedural acts, insculpted in the articles. 6o, 139<, IX, 276 and 282, in addition to the cogent rule of art. * Accordingly, there is an exceptional hypothesis, applicable to the dewrit impetration against judicial act, since the contested decision is manifestly unlawful in determining the amendment to the initial in a generic and abstract way, without accurately stating, as requested by the impetrant in its declaration embargoes, which should be done, in line with the dictates of Article 321 of the CPC/2015. In the light of the foregoing, the ordinary appeal is brought before the Court, in order to reform the judgment under appeal and grant the Pleiterate Security, so that the coator authority proceeds to the suitability of the order of amendment to the initial petition of the action of usucapio, in compliance with the dictates of Article 321 of the Civil Procedure Code.

ROUBO DUPLAMENT MAJORADO. MANTED CONDENATION. GENERAL CONCURSE. _ PENA DOSIMETRIA. REDIMENSIONATION. _ Existing evidence in the procedural notebook is sufficient for the prosecution of the conviction application deducted in the complaint. Materiality and authorship sufficiently demonstrated by the evidence produced. The negative theory of authorship verified by the defense of the defendant isolated in the autos and contradicted by the other probatory elements, consistent in the firm reports of the victims and in the testimony of the police, letting the defendant, accompanied by an unidentified pair, entered the tenant and, displaying firearm, announced the assault, both of them in seizing escape shortly after, in power of the undertracted goods. Identification of the agent via the analysis of the images collected by the security cameras of the site. Photographic recognition by offenders, in the police phase, ratified in Judgement. * _ _ According to a peaceful jurisprudential understanding, consistent witness proof in the victim\\'s word has sufficient probative value for the support of a condemnation decree, especially when it comes to crime practiced without face witnesses. The reports of the victims, when they show themselves safe and consistent, deserve to be considered elements of conviction of high importance. And the police testimony is evidence of recognized suitability, especially when accompanied by other probatory elements. * MAJORANTE BY THE CONCURSE OF HEARTS. Remaining surely demonstrated by the judicialized evidence that the defendant acted in conjunction with the wills and division of tasks with his unidentified partner, the effect of succeeding in the practice of theft, denoting subjective bond between them, is perfectly outlined to the majority by the contest of people. * PENA DOSIMETRIA. Basilar reduced to 05 (five) years and 02 (two) months of seclusion. Clear the tisne conferred on the agent\\'s vector social conduct and consequences of the crime. Preserved the unfavourable note attributed to its criminal record, with a stain still conferred on the personality modulator. In the second phase, confirmed the increment of 1/6 operated by the recurrence, which is specific, with the readequation of the provisional penalty for 06 (six) years and 10 (ten) days of seclusion. Inaltered the increase of the penalty in 3/8, in the case of theft practiced in contest of people and with the ostensive use of firearm, observed the particularities of the case. Final feathers signed in 08 (eight) years, 03 (three) months and 13 (twelve) days of seclusion, for each of the crimes. Finally, it reduced the fraction of an increase by the formal contest of crimes for 1/5, in being three the assets hit. Total penalty consolidated in 09 (nine) years, 11 ( eleven) months and 09 (nine) days of seclusion. Initial file closed. Feather of a fine reduced to 30 (thirty) days-change, to the minimum unitary reason.<br> Partially provided.<br> In this special appeal, in addition to being pointed out the presence of judicial dissidence, is indicated the violation of Art. 59 and 157, § 2o, both of the Penal Code.<br> It is stated that, through inadequate grounds, the judicial circumstance was negatively examined. Personality of the accused, given that criminal record are different from social background, so it is impossible to evaluate the personality of an individual based on his criminal record. Thus, the decision of the collegiate body makes clear the dissonant position in relation to the adopted in the Superior Courts, where the divergence in relation to the REsp 1.511.988/AC, of the rapporteur of Minister Nefi Cordeiro, in which remains demonstrated the impossibility of the exasperation of the base penalty, in relation to the vetorial Personality, when used the uncompared point of concrete elements. Thus, it is noted that the reasoning employed in the decision was that in which it was stated that definitive convictions by the accused would indicate a Personality with unfavorable traits, justifying the exasperation of the said vector. In addition to being completely inadequate the plea, as absent from justification by concrete elements, it is noted that what holds it would be the existence of convictions without transit in judgment and complaints received. .. The assessment of the Personality of the accused presupposes the analysis of concrete elements contained in the selfs, not serving so much the analysis of their criminal background. In this sense, even if there were convictions already carried out in the trial against the accused, unused as deficiencies or recurrences, they could not be used to increase the penalty for the negative analysis given to the Personality, by complete inadequacy of grounds. . The criminal record, in itself, is not representative of a bad personality, so that there are no other probatory elements in the autos, there is no other way if not the exclusion of the said vector (fl. 181).<br> It also assumes that the judgment under appeal deserves reform because of the disproportionality due to the improper exasperation of the penalty. . The fixation of the penalty above the minimum of one third in relation to the incidence of majorants, perhaps in the amount of 3/8, should always be well-founded and the analysis should be qualitative instead of quantitative, under penalty of admitting the application of the penalty objectively, without individualization. .. To prevail the understanding expended by the Eighth Criminal Chamber Colenda, the disproportionality due to equal treatment for different situations will be consolidated, because two majorants were sufficient for the penalty to remain exasperated above the minimum level laid down in law. The mere existence of two causes of an increase in sentence does not justify, in itself, the withdrawal of the minimum provided for in the Law 1.5, and with much more reason it is not justified to exasperate the sentence in 3/8 so only because there are two majorants, especially in the face of the fragility of the settled reasoning, which, say, does not present the violation of the law. The private penalty of freedom is also resized in respect of the exasperations operated on the basis of the contest of majorants, especially in view of the absence of concrete reasons, as well as because of the divergence in relation to the paradigm judgment, whose menu is above transcribed, and the Supreme Court 443 of this Superior Court of Justice, because the judgment under appeal entails a negative effect on Art. 157, § 2, 18. (f. 195/199), the special appeal was admitted to origin (f. 201/207). SPECIAL REPORT. PENA-BASE DOSIMETRIA. PERSONALITY. CRIMINAL ANTENTS. POSTERIOUS FACTS. PROVISIONS. IMPOSSIBILITY. ADMITED RESOURSE.<br> The Federal Public Prosecutor is opined by partial knowledge and, in this extension, by the provision of the insurgency (fls. 223/226). SPECIAL REPORT. BOTH. PENA-BASE. VALORATION NEGATIVATED PERSONALITY. PRETERRITE PENAL CONDENSATIONS. INIDUAL FUNDAMENTATION. MAJORATION OF PENAS IN THE THIRST PHASE. CONCRECT FUNDATION.<br>1. In the line of understanding of the STJ, \"eventual criminal convictions of the defendant carried out in trial and not used to characterize recurrence can only be valued, in the first phase of the dosimetry, in the title of criminal record, not admitting its use also to devalue the personality or social conduct of the agent\" (EREsp n.1.688.077/MS, rel. Minister Reysenaldo Soares). It does not characterize a violation of federal law when, in the dosimetry of the increased theft penalty, the judge, in the third stage, establishes an increase in the fraction of 3/8, considering the number of majorants and also the unfavorable circumstances of the crime. Incidence of Sumula n. 83/STJ.<br>3. Endorsed by the partial knowledge of the special appeal and by its provision.<br> It is the report. The basilars were fixed in 05 (five) years and 05 (five) months of seclusion due to the negative note attributed to the previous criminal vectors, social conduct and consequences of the crime.<br> In relation to social conduct, I understand that it does not represent the best technique the consideration, in the examination of this modulator, in the way that the individual\\'s involvement in the world of crime is revealed. As well teaches the abalized doctrine, social conduct \"is the role of the defendant in the community, inserted in the context of the family, the work, the school, the neighborhood, etc.\", and the valuation of this conduct \"which is not confused with antecedents - is always \"in relation to the society in which the accused is integrated, and not in relation to the \"formal society\" of men being \"good.\" I therefore withdraw the tisne conferred on the vector.<br>However, according to the certificate of fis. 61/67, the defendant records two convictions for crimes of the same kind with transit in judgment prior to the robbery sub judice. In addition, it bears five other definitive convictions for later murders of weapon size, reception, qualified theft, theft and possession of drugs, and two provisionals, for crimes of arms and reception. Such circumstances, to the evidence, denote that, in addition to reincident, it bears criminal background and personality aimed at delitive practice. Although I give up the dissent of the jurisprudential on the theme, this College has quiet understanding in the sense that the existence of the ongoing judicial process allows the exasperation of the basic penalty, without prejudice to the constitutional principle of the presumption of innocence. This is because the application of the acquisted orientation does not imply anticipating the conviction of the accused by previous episode, but so only recognize the debatable character of the fact that he is responding to the process, or of registering sentence without transit in trial, thus leaving to equip him to the defendant who has never been criminally prosecuted. Thus, the ongoing processes, as well as the convictions, by facts prior to that at trial, should be considered in the examination of the previous vector, while the subsequent criminal occurrences (processes and convictions by later fact), should be considered in the examination of the personality vector, by showing a tendency to the delitive practice. It is necessary to admit that the fact that having the agent practiced other crimes when it was already being processed criminally is a negative circumstance, which must be considered by the judge in the dosimetry of the sentence. To all evidence, this circumstance denotes personality that cannot be matched to those who do not have any criminal record.<br>The end, I have that the consequences of the crimes are not worthy of negative note. In which the goods have not been restored, I have to, individually considered in relation to each of the victims, did not represent exceptional damage.<br>E in this context, considering the withdrawal of the negative note given to one of the highlighted modulators, without oblivious to the enverging of others, I reduce the base penalty to 05 (five) years and 02 (two) months of reclusion. > In fact, as regards the negativeness of the personality, the understanding of the ordinary court is in dissonance with the jurisprudence of the Superior Court of Justice, in view of the illegality of the use of criminal record with the disregard to negatively value the said judicial circumstance. * In fact, the Court of origin did not adopt suitable grounds to justify the exasperation of the base penalty above the legal minimum with respect to personality and social conduct, because the sentenced judge used the patient\\'s criminal background to increase under these vectors and also in the title of bad antecedents, configuring undue bis in idem. Therefore, the sanction imposed must be reduced (HC no. 449.353/SP, Minister Maria Thereza de Assis Moura, Sixth Class, DJe 13/8/2018 - our designer). The Third Chamber of this Superior Court has held that the Third Chamber of this Superior Court has: ADMISSION OF THE PUBLIC MINISTRY OF JANUARY RIO WITH CURIAE AMICUS: DESNECESSITY. DOSIMETRIA. NEGATIVE VALORATION OF ANTECTENT MAUS AND PERSONALITY. HE WANTED TO MULTIPLE DEFINITIVE CONDENATIONS. INIDUAL FUNDAMENTATION. _ RESURSE PROVITED.<br>1. The amicus curiae acts in the process as a true collaborator of justice, whose intervention is justified in the need to open the legal dialogue to society, in view of the existence of issues that exceed the interests merely of the parties. It is possible, in other words, to debate not only legal but also metajuridical, qualifying the information of the self in order to contribute to decisions with greater democratic legitimacy through a cooperative process. Its admission to the criminal proceedings (Art. 3 of the CPP), however, in addition to the requirements described in Art. 138 of the CPC/2015 (relevance of matter, specificity of the subject matter of demand or the social repercussion of controversy), is based fundamentally on its ability to contribute to the elucidation of the subject of controversy, taking into account its expertise and/or experience in the field of action related to the situation analyzed in the bojo process of the process of the The admission of another State Prosecutor\\'s Office as amicus curiae is not useful if the institution is already sufficiently represented by the State Prosecutor\\'s Office which initiated the criminal action and figure as resorted to the embargoes of divergence, as well as by the Federal Prosecutor\\'s Office, both with the possibility of manifesting itself in the self and making use of the word on the occasion of the trial, even more so that the only contribution to the merit of the dispute brought by the alleged intervening argument was the topic precedent quote On the other hand, considering that the institution of the Public Prosecutor is one, nothing prevents the follow-up of the issue by the Public Prosecutor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, in reinforcement of the interpretation advocated by the prosecution, but always in collaboration with the Public Prosecutor of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, which is now under appeal. Any criminal convictions of the defendant carried on trial and not used to characterize the recurrence can only be valued, in the first phase of the dosimetry, by criminal record, by not admitting its use also to devalue the personality or social conduct of the agent. Precedents of the Fifth and the Sixth Class of this Court.<br>3. The social conduct and personality of the agent are not confused with the criminal background, because they enjoy their own contours - they refer to the way of being and acting of the perpetrator -, which cannot be automatically deducted from the criminal record of the defendant. It is the performance of the defendant in the community, in the family context, in the work, in the neighborhood (social conflict), of its temperament and the characteristics of its character, to which hereditary and socioenvironmental factors are added, shaped by the experiences lived by the agent (social personality). The judicial circumstance of the antecedents is eminently given to the analysis of the criminal sheet of the defendant, when possible history of multiple definitive convictions can, at the discretion of the judge, be valued more emphaticly, which alone already demonstrates the need to negatively value other definitive convictions in the personality vectors and social conduct. There is a specific judicial circumstance aimed at valuing the criminal record of the defendant, it is unnecessary and \"in addition to the use of previous convictions carried out in the trial to infer as negative the personality or the social conduct of the agent\" (HC 366.639/SP, Rel. Minister FELIX FISCHER, QUINTA TURMA, judged on 28/3/2017, DJe). Such a directive was more recently received by the Sixth Class of this Court: REsp 1760972/MG, Rel. Minister SEBASTIÃO REIS JÚNIOR, SEXTA TURMA, judged on 08/11/2018, DJe 04/12/2018 and HC 472.654/DF, Rel. LAURITA VAZ, SEXTA TURMA, judged on 21/02/2019, DJe 11/03/2019. Consolidated jurisprudential uniformization.<br>5. In casu, the conviction imposed on the applicant increased its basic penalty above the legal minimum, improperly valuing both the offense of bodily injury (129, § 9, of the Penal Code) and the threat (Art. 147, CP), its personality and its bad antecedents on the basis of different criminal convictions carried out in judgment<.br>6. Extiring the personality vector, in the first phase of the dosimetry, remains, in both crimes, the vector \"criminal precedents\", which justifies the elevation of the base penalty above the legal minimum.<br>7. Discipline of divergence provided, to, reforming the judgment under appeal, provide for the regimental agrave of the defendant and, consequently, know of his agravo and provide for his special appeal, reducing, the penalties imposed on the applicant in proportion to the improper increase attributed to the vector \"personality\", in the first phase of the dosimetry. Considered that the crime was committed with the use of a firearm and in a contest of people, increase the sanction in 3/8, totaling the penalty in ILO ANS IIGHT MES AND ILO RECLUSION DAYS. > Finally, in view that the evidence presented surely demonstrates that the offence was practiced by two agents, and that it was the defendant who announced the assault carrying the weapon used to reduce and neutralize any reaction of the offended, depending on whether it affects the images captured by the local monitoring cameras, repute that the increase in the fraction of 3/8 was proportional and adequate to the situation in consideration, and should be preserved the penalty of each > With regard to the claim of an increase in the penalty in the third stage of the dosimetry at the level beyond 1/3, without the proper reasoning, I have the same luck to the applicant. The jurisprudence of this Court concluded that, for the elevation of the reprimand above 1/3, due to the contest of majorants in the theft crime, it is necessary concrete reasoning concerning their need (Sumula 443/STJ).

This Court and the Supreme Court have pacified guidance in the sense that it is not up to habeas corpus substitutive of the legally foreseen recourse to the hypothesis, imposing the non-knowledge of the impetration, unless the existence of flagrant illegality in the contested judicial act to justify the granting of the order of office. According to this Court, the size of drugs for own use was not decriminalized with the entry into force of Law 11.343/2006, having only been the mere decriminalization of such conduct, since the said penal type brought only the comination of alternative penalties to the offender. Thus, the existence of a definitive conviction prior to infringement of Article 28 of the Drugs Act is a circumstance capable of authorizing the aggravation of the penalty for recurrence, as well as to prevent the application of the reduction of Art.<br>33, § 4 of the said standard.<br>3. \"The increase in the third stage of application of the penalty in the crime of circumstantial theft requires concrete reasoning, not sufficient for its exasperation to mere indication of the number of majorants.\" (Sumula 443/STJ). 4. In the event, the ordinary instances concretely justified the increase in the sentence in 3/8, by the presence of the majority of the firearm employment and the agents\\' contest, highlighting that \"to achieve the criminal offence, the accused united efforts to his comparse, in true communion of designs, through the ostensive use of two firearms to increase the intimidation power of the victims and to achieve success in the denouncement described goods\". Habeas corpus not known.<br>(HC n. 447.338/SC, Minister Ribeiro Dantas, Quinta Turma, DJe 28/8/2018 - rifo ours).<br> It is possible to note, from the reading of the autos, that the ordinary instances fixed the respective percentage at the level of 3/8 only because of the number of majorants, which evidences illegality, because the criterion of elevation of the reprimand in the third phase of the dosimetry has a subjective character, and not merely a mathematician, depending on the circumstances of the concrete case. * As far as it is provided, I move to the necessary resizing of the appellant\\'s private penalty of freedom:<br> Due to the withdrawal of the negativeion given to the personality\\'s judicial vector, preserved the devaluation conceived to the antecedents, the base penalty of 5 years and 2 months of seclusion (f. 163) is reduced to 4 years and 7 months of seclusion. * In accordance with the combated aresto, the increase in the sentence in 1/6 remains, in the second phase, in the exact terms of the contested sentence, in the case of specific recurrence, which leads to provisionally 5 years, 4 months and 5 days of reclusion. <br> In the final stage, the fraction of the causes of increase from 3/8 (fl. 166) to 1/3 is reduced, reaching 7 years, 1 month and 16 days of seclusion. Still in the third stage, considering that the applicant, through a single action, has reached three distinct assets (from the tenant, Fernando and Lucas Pozza), the fraction of an increase is preserved by the formal contest in 1/5 (fl. 166), totaling the private penalty of freedom in 8 years, 6 months and 19 days of seclusion. * In the light of the foregoing, on the basis of Art. 255, Paragraph 4, III, of the RISTJ, provides the special remedy to remove the negativeity of the judicial circumstance of the personality, as well as to decrease the fraction applied for the causes of increase of the penalty, and the private reprimand of freedom of the resized applicant in accordance with this Decision.

       "        \"DECISION<br> It was considered an ordinary appeal in habeas corpus interposed by RAFAEL OLIVEIRA NERES against the judgment of the Court of Justice of São Paulo that maintained the requirement of compliance with 60% of the conviction for the purposes of progression of the regime of compliance with the penalty. The applicant insists on the recognition of the inapplicability of the indicated percentage, contending that it is not a specific recurrence in heinous crime; adduces the impropriety of the chosen route does not away with the possibility of granting the order of office, in view of the manifest violation of its net right and certain progression in the enforcement of penalty in the form of the law. The Tribunal a quo did not know the impetration because it is a judicial act subject to its own appeal, i.e. criminally enforced (Art. 197 of the Law of Criminal Executions), noting that there is no teratology or illegality in the contested decision. The injunction request was dismissed (fls.79-80).<br> The Federal Prosecutor opins the non-knowledge of the request, noting whether it is a repetition of another veiculate in the HC 652.957, in which the order was granted of office.<br> It's the report. In that regard, the judgment under appeal does not deserve repairs. In fact, the arguments deduced by the applicants at no time managed to clear the pleas of the Court which, in summary, concluded by the impropriety of the election route. The jurisprudence of the Superior Courts was consolidated in the sense of the exceptionality of the control of judicial decisions by the security warrant, restricting it to hypotheses of illegality or teratology, absent, in the species. As regards the pretension of overcoming the procedural obstacle indicated, with the pleiteadaconcession of the order of office, I find that remains undermined by the adoption of this same provision in a decision made in the Habeas Corpus 652.957, of my rapporteur, whose device is thus drawn up: Before the foregoing, I do not know of habeas corpus, but, from office, I grant the order to determine the rectification of the calculation of the patient's pen, observing, as a objective requirement, compliance with the percentage of 40% of the conviction for the purposes of regime progression.
